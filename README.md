There are four designated pick-up and drop-off locations (Red, Green, Yellow and Blue) in the 5x5 grid world. The taxi starts off at a randm square and the passenger at one of the designated locations. The goal: move the taxi to the passenger’s location, pick up the passenger, move to the passenger’s desired destination, and drop off the passenger.
